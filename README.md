These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework


Projects:

News Letter App


Car Insurance:
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website.It takes users input on policy
information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff
to view all of the quotes that have been issued.


News Letter App:
This project is an MVC web app that lets users enter there information in order to be signed up to a news letter. After the form is submitted the information
is saved on a SQL server for further review. There is also an admin page that shows who is subscribed along with a function to unsubscribe a indivedual from the list.
